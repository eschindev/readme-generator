## Description
A small tool for automatically generating a README.md for a software project, based on a series of prompts answered by the developer.

## Installation
Clone the repository and run npm install to ensure that the dependencies, inquirer and fs, are installed before running index.js

## Usage
When you run index.js, you will be prompted to enter information about your project. Once you respond to all of the prompts, a README.md will be generated containing all of the information entered.
